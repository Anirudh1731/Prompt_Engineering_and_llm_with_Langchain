Hence, the important parameters of intracranial \\npressure sensor are the sensitivity and linearity.

INTRODUCTION \\nThe sensors developed using the MEMS technology have \\ntremendously shrunk in size make them ideal for biomedical \\napplication like intracranial monitoring devices. Using a small \\npressure sensor requires a small intubation, makes the healing \\ntime shorter and minimizes the risk of infection. Based on [1], \\nthe most common location for intracranial pressure (lCP) \\nmonitoring is cerebral parenchymal and contemporary \\nintracranial pressure sensor of that location is a piezoresistive \\npressure sensor. Although the piezoresistive output is \\nsensitive to temperature changes, it could be corrected easily \\nby using a simple compensation circuit, namely Wheatstone \\nbridge [2]. Ideally, the ICP pressure sensor should be durable, bio\\xad\\ncompatible and inexpensive. As ICP monitoring deals with \\nthe well-being, therefore accuracy and sensitivity of the ICP \\npressure sensors are very crucial. The sensitivity of the \\ncommercially available ICP microtransducer is 5 fl V N ImmHg \\n(Gaeltec & Raumedic). Based on the academic researches, the \\nsensitivities of the piezoresistive sensors were within the range \\nof 2 fl V N ImmHg to 0.17 m V N ImmHg [3-10]. To obtain the \\naccurate readings, several factors need to be considered such \\nas the shapes of piezoresistors and the dimensions of the \\ndiaphragm. For the ICP application, its critical point is the \\nsize of the sensor itself. It needs to be small enough to fit into \\nthe probe. The smallest size of ICP pressure sensor for the \\nadult is 500 flm x 500 flm with the sensitivity of 2 \\nfl V N ImmHg, but it is for the lumbar area [10]. \\nThis paper presents the design of an ICP piezoresistive \\npressure sensor using three turns meander shaped \\npiezoresistors. Thus far, only the one turn meander shaped \\npiezoresistors have been applied in the designs ofICP pressure \\nsensor [5, 7, 9, 10] while [3] have used the three turns \\nmeander shaped piezoresistors on the cantilever, not on the \\ndiaphragm like this work. The size of diaphragm used is 200 \\nflm x 200 flm x 2 flm using n-type silicon. The targeted \\nlocation of ICP pressure sensor is the subarachnoid space with \\nthe measurable pressure within the range of 0 -100 mmHg. \\nII. PIEZORESISTIVE PRESSURE SENSOR \\nA piezoresistive pressure sensor is normally consists of 4 \\npiezoresistors arranged in Wheatstone bridge configuration as \\nillustrated in Fig. I. When no pressure is applied, the output \\nvoltage, Vaut is zero as all the piezoresistors are equal, \\ntherefore the bridge is in a balanced state. When the \\ndiaphragm deflects due to the applied pressure, these \\npiezoresistors\\' values change accordingly. For the p-type \\npiezoresistors oriented at <110> on an-type (100) silicon \\nsubstrate, change in resistance value is expressed in (I) [2]. \\n978-1-5090-4568-6/16/$31.00 ©2016 IEEE Rj diaphragm \\nr - - - -0--\\'~-J\"\"-l--------\\n: --I \\nI R2 R31 b d \\nI 1 \\n1 \\\\J 1 \\n~ ___ CJ ____ ~ R, [J \\n(a) (b) (c) \\nFig. l.

DESIGN METHODOLOGY \\nThe sensors were designed based on the specifications \\nsummarized in Table I. The size of the sensor was set in \\norder to fit into 4FR probe. The sensitivity of greater than \\n0.01 mV/V/mmHg was set as the previous research for the \\nsame sensor size is 2 f..lV/V/mmHg [10]. The design stage was \\nsegregated into two, i.e. determine (a) the location for the \\npiezoresistors on the diaphragm size of 200 f..lm x 200 f..lm x 2 \\n/lm and (b) the best piezoresistors configuration. A square \\ndiaphragm is selected because it has 60 % higher mechanical \\nstress instead of circular one for the same thickness [7]. \\nA. Selection ofPiezoresistors Placement, Size and Shape \\nP-type piezoresistors (with doping concentration of 1015 \\natomlcm3) oriented at <110> on an-type (100) silicon \\nsubstrate were chosen in the designs. These piezoresistors \\nneed to be placed in the high stress region [2, 11, 12]. Hence, \\nthe von Mises stress result from the COMSOL Multiphysics \\nsimulation was used as illustrated in Fig. 2. The high stress \\nregion was found within the diaphragm and near the center of \\nthe edges, i.e. the red region. This is in agreement with the \\ntheory which states that the center of edges are experiencing TABLE I.

Surface von-Mises stress of the diaphragm at pressure of 100 mmHg. \\nmore mechanical stress than the central point [2]. As the 2 /lm \\nthickness is considered a thin diaphragm, the high stress \\nregion is not extended into the bulk silicon area as mentioned \\nin [II, 12]. Therefore, the four piezoresistors were positioned \\nat the center of the diaphragm\\'s edges. Three types of piezoresistors were used in the design as \\ndepicted in Fig. 3. The piezoresistors were comprised of \\npiezoresistive bars (p-type) and connecting bars (metal). The \\nconnecting bars will not contribute to the piezoresistive effect \\n[12]. The piezoresistors sizes were designed to fit into the \\nhigh stress regions [II]. Hence, the dimension of O-turn \\nmeander shaped piezoresistor was set to 80 /lm x 5 /lm. To \\nensure the equal resistances at the no load condition, the total \\nlength of the piezoresistive bar must be equal [11]. Therefore, \\nthe piezoresistive bars of I-turn and 3-turns meander shaped \\npiezoresistors were set to be fractions of 80 /lm as shown in \\nTable 2. \\nB. Selection ofDifierent Piezoresistors Configurations \\nFour models of different piezoresistors sensors were \\nselected as shown in Fig. 4 in accomplishing the high \\nsensitivity sensor. The models were selected based on the \\nresearches by [11, 12]. In order to test their performances, the \\nsimulations were done by using COM SOL Multiphysics \\nthrough Structural Mechanics Module -Piezoresistivity, \\nBoundary Currents. Combinations of tetrahedral mesh (for \\ndiaphragm and substrate) and quadrilateral mesh (for circuit \\nelements) were used in this project. \\nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS \\nTo ensure the linearity and sensitivity performance of the \\npressure sensor, several parameters need to be considered. \\nThese critical key factors include the shape and location of \\npiezoresistors. \\nA. Analysis of Sensitivity PerfOrmance of the Sensors \\nFig. 5 shows the output voltage of each model. All the \\nmodels achieve the targeted specification for sensitivity, i.e. \\nabove 0.01 mVIV/mmHg. Model 2, which comprised of 0-\\nturn and 3-turns piezoresistors gives the highest sensitivity of \\n0.125 m V IV /mmHg, followed closely by Model 3 which is \\ncomposed of I-turn and 3-turns meander shaped piezoresistors \\nwith the sensitivity of 0.122 mVIV/mmHg. Meanwhile, \\nModell gives the lowest sensitivity of 0.101 mVIV/mmHg. \\nThe results are supported with the graph of change in \\nresistance of different piezoresistor shapes, illustrated in Fig. \\n6.

[t is followed by the I-turn \\npiezoresistor placed perpendicular to the diaphragm in which \\nthe change in resistance, +/l..R/R = 1.1 E-3 per 10 mmHg. The \\nresults concur with [II, 12] that the sensitivity will be \\nimproved as the number of vertical bar increases. It is due to \\nthe maximum distribution area of the piezoresistor on the \\nhigh-stress region in comparison to the other types of \\npiezoresistors [II]. \\nHowever, the placement of piezoresistor also plays an \\nimportant factor [2, 14] as illustrated in Fig. 6.

The \\nworst linearity performance (in which the non-linearity of \\n1.I2E-3%) was by Model 4 which comprises of three turns \\npiezoresistors only. This is in trend with the results obtained \\nby [11, 12]. The more number of turns ofpiezoresistor causes \\nthe distinct variation of resistance between the perpendicular \\nand parallel bars which contributes to worsen linearity [11]. \\nTABLE III.

CONCLUSION \\nOverall, all the models achieved the targeted sensitivity \\nand linearity of ICP pressure sensor, i.e. above 0.01 \\nmV/V/mmHg and 90% respectively. This sensitivity is higher \\nthan the one achieved by the similar sensor size. Model 2 \\nwhich consolidates the O-turn and 3-turns meander shaped \\npiezoresistors gives the highest sensitivity for pressure range from 0 to 100 mmHg. However, the best linearity \\nperformance is by Modell which composed of the O-turn and \\n2-turns meander shaped piezoresistors. This shows that the \\nsensitivity and linearity ofthe sensor are very much influenced \\nby the shapes of piezoresistors and their placements on the \\ndiaphragm. The 3-turns meander shaped piezoresistor \\npositioned perpendicular to the diaphragm gives the highest \\nchange in resistance which results in the highest sensitivity. \\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \\nThe work is supported by the University Malaya Research \\nGrant UMRG-AET (Grant Number RPOI4B-13AET).
