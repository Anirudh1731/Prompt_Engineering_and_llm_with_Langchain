Income tax is a type of tax that is paid on the money you earn from various sources, such as your salary, wages, investments, and business profits.\\n\\nThe amount of income tax you owe is determined by your taxable income, which is the total amount of money you earn minus any deductions or exemptions. The tax rates for different income levels are set by the government and may change from year to year.\\n\\nThere are two main types of income tax: federal and state. Federal income tax is collected by the federal government and applies to all individuals and businesses in the United States. State income tax is collected by individual states and may vary depending on where you live.\\n\\nThe IRS, or Internal Revenue Service, is the government agency in charge of collecting federal income tax. Every year, individuals must file their tax returns, which is a document that reports their income and calculates how much tax they owe. The deadline for filing tax returns is typically April 15th of each year.\\n\\nThere are various ways to lower your taxable income and reduce the amount of tax you owe. One way is through deductions, which are expenses that can be subtracted from your taxable'"
